The best way to work with Python is by using 
Virtual Environment. Virtual Environment avoids 
installing packages globally.
pip is the to go package installer for Python 

#install an individual package 
pip install colorama 

#install from a list of packages 
pip install -r requirements.txt 

#requirements.txt 
colorama 

In order to use VirtualEnv: 

>> pip install virtualenv 
#windows 
python -m venv <folder_name>

#linux 
virtualenv <folder_name>

Activating Virtual Environments: 

# windows 
# cmd.exe 

<folder_name>\Scripts\Activate.bat 

# powershell 
<folder_name>\Scripts\Activate.ps1 

# bash shell 
. ./<folder_name>/Scripts/activate 

# Linux 
<folder_name>/bin/activate 

After you activate virtual environment, then you can install 
packages like you install them globally.
